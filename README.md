# Sorting CSV using Node.js file system package.
This is a repository showing how to sort a CSV file using Node.js. 
A small part of the data was extracted and placed in a separate file (MockData.csv) and I wrote some syntax to sort this first before introducing the large dataset into the syntax.

## There are two scripts in this repository:
- Sort CSV by date.     
It shows how the CSV file is sorted in ascending order using the date value.

- Filter CSV by location and security level.     
It filters the CSV file based on the location and the security level value.
